## Use the enviroment

Using feature selection, it’s possible to achieve a perfect classification; only using the features 0,2,4 questions which have the most significant values, so you can remove the rest of the questions. Anyway, for all the model tested Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes my recommendation is the logistic regression because it have a previous training and require less time that the other model that require training, however if the training is no require, I will go for the naïve bayes, because it’s a probabilistic method.
Finally, the database is too small to create reliable method by now.
